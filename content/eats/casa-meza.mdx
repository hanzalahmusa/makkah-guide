Morocco and Saudi Arabia share more culinary DNA than most people realise — both love slow-cooked meats, aromatic spices, and bread as a centrepiece. Casa Meza bridges these traditions beautifully.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **chicken tagine** is the signature dish and deserves its reputation. Slow-cooked with preserved lemons and olives, it arrives in a traditional clay pot with steam rising and aromas that stop conversations. The couscous is fluffy, properly steamed, and served with a vegetable stew that's rich without being heavy.

Order the **Moroccan mint tea** to finish. It's prepared traditionally — poured from a height to create froth — and makes a perfect end to the meal.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

The restaurant is small and intimate — maybe 15 tables. Decor leans into Moroccan aesthetics with tiled walls and copper lamps. It feels personal, like someone's home dining room.

Casa Meza is a delightful detour from the usual Makkah dining circuit. The tagine alone is worth the visit, and the intimate atmosphere makes it feel like a discovery rather than just another restaurant.
