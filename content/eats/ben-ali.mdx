If you've never tried camel meat, Ben Ali is where you should have your first encounter. This no-frills grill house in Al Shoqiyah has been serving camel kebabs long before food blogging existed, and the quality speaks for itself.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

**Camel meat kebabs** are the star — leaner than beef, slightly gamey, and incredibly tender when prepared well. Ben Ali's kebabs are skewered, charcoal-grilled, and served with fresh flatbread and a selection of dips. The flavour is distinctive — earthy, rich, and unlike anything you've had before.

If camel isn't your thing, the lamb and chicken kebabs are excellent too. But you came this far — at least try one skewer. You'll be surprised.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

Outdoor seating, charcoal smoke drifting through the air, and a crowd that's mostly local. This isn't a tourist restaurant. You eat, you enjoy, you leave satisfied.

Ben Ali is a story you'll tell when you get home. The food is genuinely good, the experience is authentic, and the camel kebabs become one of those unexpected highlights of a Makkah trip.
