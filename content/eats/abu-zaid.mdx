---

There are hundreds of foul restaurants in Makkah. Abu Zaid is the one locals name when you ask where to go. The foul is slow-cooked, properly seasoned, and served with tamees bread that's baked fresh throughout the morning.

## Why This Place

The foul here has depth — it's not just mashed beans with oil. There's cumin, tomato, and a hint of chili that builds warmth without overwhelming. The tamees bread is soft, slightly chewy, and perfect for scooping.

## The Routine

Most regulars arrive between Fajr and 8 AM. Order at the counter, find a seat, and your food appears within minutes. It's efficient, clean, and no-nonsense — exactly what you want when you're fueling up for a day at the Haram.

## Value

A full breakfast with foul, bread, tea, and maybe some falafel on the side costs around 15-20 SAR. For the quality and quantity, it's remarkable value.

## Our Take

Start your Makkah mornings here instead of the hotel buffet. It's cheaper, tastier, and infinitely more memorable. The tamees bread alone is worth the trip to Aziziyah.
