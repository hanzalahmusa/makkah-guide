There are hundreds of foul restaurants in Makkah. Abu Zaid is the one locals name when you ask where to go. The foul is slow-cooked, properly seasoned, and served with tamees bread that's baked fresh throughout the morning.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **foul** here has depth — it's not just mashed beans with oil. There's cumin, tomato, and a hint of chili that builds warmth without overwhelming. The **tamees bread** is soft, slightly chewy, and perfect for scooping. Add some **falafel** on the side for the complete experience.

A full breakfast with foul, bread, tea, and falafel costs around **15-20 SAR**. For the quality and quantity, it's remarkable value.

Most regulars arrive between Fajr and 8 AM. Order at the counter, find a seat, and your food appears within minutes.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

Start your Makkah mornings here instead of the hotel buffet. It's cheaper, tastier, and infinitely more memorable. The tamees bread alone is worth the trip to Aziziyah. This is the kind of place that makes you feel like you've actually visited Makkah, not just the Haram.
