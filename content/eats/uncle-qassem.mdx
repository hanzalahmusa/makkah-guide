---

Uncle Qassem is the kind of restaurant that doesn't appear on any tourist list — and that's exactly what makes it special. Tucked away in Al Rasaifah, it serves home-style Arabic food that tastes like someone's grandmother made it.

## The Food

Daily rotating dishes served from large pots — stewed meats, vegetable curries, fragrant rice dishes, and fresh bread. You point at what looks good, and it's served with genuine warmth. The flavours are complex and comforting in equal measure.

## The Experience

This is neighbourhood dining at its most authentic. Families from the area eat here regularly. The owner greets regulars by name. There's no English menu, but the universal language of pointing at delicious food works perfectly.

## Why It Matters

Restaurants like Uncle Qassem represent the real Makkah food scene — unpretentious, community-focused, and deeply satisfying. Eating here connects you to the city in a way that hotel restaurants simply cannot.

## Our Take

Make the trip to Al Rasaifah at least once. Uncle Qassem won't be the fanciest meal of your trip, but it might be the most memorable. Budget about 20-30 SAR for a filling meal.
