Mandi is one of those dishes where the simplicity is deceptive. Rice, chicken, smoke, spice — when it's done right, it's one of the most satisfying meals in the Arabian Peninsula. Bait Al Mandi does it right.

## The Food

The chicken mandi platter arrives on a bed of basmati rice that's been infused with the smoke from the cooking pit. The chicken is tender enough to fall off the bone, with a subtle smokiness that permeates every bite. Comes with a tangy sahawiq sauce that ties everything together.

## How It Works

Order at the counter — chicken or lamb mandi, half or full. Grab a table in the family section or the singles area. Food arrives on a large platter meant for sharing. Eat with your hands for the full experience.

## The Setting

Simple, clean, functional. No frills, no pretence. This is a restaurant that puts everything into the food and nothing into the decor.

## Our Take

When you're tired of fast food and hotel restaurants, Bait Al Mandi is the reset button. Honest food, generous portions, and prices that make you do a double-take.
