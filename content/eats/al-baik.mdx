Let's be honest — no Makkah guide is complete without Al Baik. This Saudi institution has achieved something remarkable: fast food that people genuinely get excited about, trip after trip.

## Why the Hype is Real

The broasted chicken is crispy, juicy, and served with Al Baik's signature garlic sauce that has launched a thousand debates about the secret recipe. At around 15-20 SAR for a full meal, it's also absurdly good value.

## Beat the Queue

The branches near the Haram can have 30-minute queues during peak times. Strategy: go immediately after Isha prayer when most people head to Tawaf, or try the branches slightly further from the Haram. The Ajyad Street branch is usually less crowded.

## Beyond Chicken

The shrimp meal is the sleeper hit. Fish fillet is solid. But let's be real — you're here for the chicken.

## Our Take

Is it the best food in Makkah? No. Is it an essential experience? Absolutely. There's something about eating Al Baik at 2 AM after Tahajjud that becomes a core Umrah memory.
