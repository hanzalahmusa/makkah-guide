Al Qarmoshi is the kind of place you'd walk past without a second glance — and that's exactly why locals love it. No branding, no Instagram presence, just proper Hijazi food served the way it's been made for generations.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **mutabbaq** is the star — a stuffed pastry that's crispy outside, savoury inside, and costs almost nothing. The **liver sandwiches** are polarising but brilliant: tender, well-spiced, wrapped in fresh bread. If you've only eaten hotel breakfast in Makkah, this will reset your expectations.

Expect communal seating, paper-lined tables, and food that arrives fast. No menus in English, but pointing works perfectly. The staff are warm and used to curious visitors.

It's a short taxi ride from the Haram area to Umm al-Qura Road. The drive itself is worth it — you'll see parts of Makkah that most visitors never encounter.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

This is real Makkah eating. Not polished, not curated — just honest food at honest prices that connects you to the city's culinary heritage. The kind of place that makes a trip feel authentic.
