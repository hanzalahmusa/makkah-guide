---

The InterContinental Dar Al Tawhid is the closest hotel to the Haram, and Al Deyafa is its signature restaurant. When you want a premium buffet without losing a single prayer time, this is where you go.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **shawaya grilled chicken** is the highlight — marinated for hours and grilled to order with a smoky char that keeps you coming back for seconds. Beyond that, the buffet spans traditional Arabic dishes, a carving station, fresh seafood, and a pastry counter that rivals standalone bakeries.

The **dinner buffet** is the main event. Arrive early (around 7 PM) for the best selection and a calmer atmosphere. The restaurant fills up quickly after Maghrib prayer.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

Al Deyafa is the splurge-worthy option for a special Umrah meal. The food quality matches the setting, and the location is unbeatable. You can literally walk from your prayer mat to your dinner table in under five minutes — for families with elderly members or young children, this proximity is invaluable. One dinner here, timed right, becomes a trip highlight.
