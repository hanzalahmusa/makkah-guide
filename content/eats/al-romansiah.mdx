---

Al Romansiah is the Saudi restaurant chain that doesn't feel like a chain. Every branch delivers consistently good kabsa, saleeg, and traditional Saudi dishes — the kind of food that makes you understand why rice-and-meat cuisine has sustained this region for centuries.

## The Must-Orders

The kabsa is textbook — fragrant rice, well-spiced meat, and the right amount of richness. The saleeg (creamy white rice with chicken) is comfort food in its purest form. Order both and share.

## Why It Works

Multiple branches across Makkah mean there's always one nearby. The quality doesn't vary between locations, which is rare. Clean interiors, efficient service, and portions sized for sharing.

## Practical Notes

Family sections are spacious and well-maintained. Prices are moderate — expect 60-90 SAR for a generous meal for two. Most branches accept cards. Parking is usually straightforward.

## Our Take

Al Romansiah won't surprise you, but it will satisfy you every single time. When the group can't agree on where to eat, this is the safe bet that everyone ends up enjoying.
