Al Romansiah is the Saudi restaurant chain that doesn't feel like a chain. Every branch delivers consistently good kabsa, saleeg, and traditional Saudi dishes — the kind of food that makes you understand why rice-and-meat cuisine has sustained this region for centuries.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **kabsa** is textbook — fragrant rice, well-spiced meat, and the right amount of richness. The **saleeg** (creamy white rice with chicken) is comfort food in its purest form. Order both and share.

Multiple branches across Makkah mean there's always one nearby. Portions are sized for sharing — expect **60-90 SAR** for a generous meal for two. Most branches accept cards.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

Al Romansiah won't surprise you, but it will satisfy you every single time. When the group can't agree on where to eat, this is the safe bet that everyone ends up enjoying. Family sections are spacious and well-maintained, the quality doesn't vary between locations, and parking is usually straightforward.
