If you want to eat well without leaving the Haram neighbourhood, Al Shorfa is your answer. Tucked inside the Abraj Al-Bait complex, it serves refined Arabic food with views that make you pause between bites.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **lamb kabsa** here is cooked slowly — tender, aromatic, and served with a spread of mezze that actually tastes freshly made. The **hummus** has character. The **fattoush** has crunch. The grilled meats are seasoned properly, not just salted and thrown on a flame.

A full meal for two with drinks runs around **150-200 SAR**. Portion sizes are generous. Request a window table when you arrive — it's worth the short wait.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

This is where you go when you want a proper sit-down meal without trekking across the city. The combination of location, quality, and atmosphere is hard to beat this close to the Haram. Floor-to-ceiling windows facing the Haram make the night view genuinely breathtaking. Service is polished and quick, which matters when you're eating between prayers.
