If you want to eat well without leaving the Haram neighbourhood, Al Shorfa is your answer. Tucked inside the Abraj Al-Bait complex, it serves refined Arabic food with views that make you pause between bites.

## The Food

The lamb kabsa here is cooked slowly — tender, aromatic, and served with a spread of mezze that actually tastes freshly made. The hummus has character. The fattoush has crunch. The grilled meats are seasoned properly, not just salted and thrown on a flame.

## The Setting

Floor-to-ceiling windows facing the Haram. At night, the view is genuinely breathtaking. Request a window table when you arrive — it's worth the short wait.

## Practical Notes

Prices are higher than street-level restaurants, but the portion sizes are generous. A full meal for two with drinks runs around 150-200 SAR. Service is polished and quick, which matters when you're eating between prayers.

## Our Take

This is where you go when you want a proper sit-down meal without trekking across the city. The combination of location, quality, and atmosphere is hard to beat this close to the Haram.
