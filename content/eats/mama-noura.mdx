At 2 AM in Makkah, when you've just finished Tahajjud and your body needs fuel, Mama Noura is where you end up. And you'll be glad you did.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **chicken shawarma** is the crowd favourite — perfectly wrapped, generously filled, and served with a garlic sauce that haunts your taste memory. The mixed plate (chicken + beef) is the move if you're genuinely hungry.

Cash is still easier here, though cards are accepted. Queue moves fast. Takeaway is the norm — grab your food and find a spot to sit outside.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

It's 2 AM. Everyone is in the same boat — spiritually elevated, physically exhausted, genuinely hungry. There's a camaraderie in the queue that you don't find during daytime dining. Quick service, no fuss, just good food.

Mama Noura is the kind of place that earns its reputation one shawarma at a time. No marketing needed — just consistent, satisfying food when you need it most.
