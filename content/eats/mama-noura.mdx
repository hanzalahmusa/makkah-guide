---

At 2 AM in Makkah, when you've just finished Tahajjud and your body needs fuel, Mama Noura is where you end up. And you'll be glad you did.

## The Shawarma

Perfectly wrapped, generously filled, and served with a garlic sauce that haunts your taste memory. The chicken shawarma is the crowd favourite, but the mixed plate (chicken + beef) is the move if you're genuinely hungry.

## The Vibe

It's 2 AM. Everyone is in the same boat — spiritually elevated, physically exhausted, genuinely hungry. There's a camaraderie in the queue that you don't find during daytime dining. Quick service, no fuss, just good food.

## Practical Notes

Cash is still easier here, though cards are accepted. Queue moves fast. Takeaway is the norm — grab your food and find a spot to sit outside.
