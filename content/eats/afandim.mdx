After days of kabsa, shawarma, and grilled chicken, your palate starts craving something different. Afandim in Al Diyafah answers that call with fresh seafood and surprisingly good pizza.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **seafood platter** is the move — a generous spread of grilled fish, prawns, and calamari served with rice and dipping sauces. Everything tastes fresh, which is impressive given Makkah's inland location. The fish is well-seasoned and cooked with a light touch.

The **seafood pizza** ties the menu together nicely — thin crust, quality toppings, and baked in a proper oven. Yes, pizza in Makkah, and it's legitimately good.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

Al Diyafah is one of Makkah's more vibrant commercial districts. The area buzzes with energy in the evenings, and there's good people-watching from the restaurant's outdoor seating.

Afandim is a palate cleanser in the best sense. When your group has had enough Arabic food for the day and someone suggests "something different," this is where you end up — and everyone leaves happy.
