seoDescription: "Relish Lebanese restaurant in Makkah's Al Kakiyyah — authentic mixed grills, mezze, and Beirut-style dining worth the short drive."
---

Makkah's food scene is dominated by Saudi and Yemeni cuisine, which makes Relish a welcome change of pace. This Lebanese restaurant in Al Kakiyyah serves food that would hold its own on a Beirut street.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **mixed grill platter** is the centrepiece — perfectly charred kebabs, juicy chicken tawook, and tender lamb chops arranged over a bed of saffron rice. The mezze selection is equally strong: creamy hummus, smoky moutabal, and tabbouleh with enough parsley to actually taste fresh.

Al Kakiyyah is about 10-15 minutes by taxi from the Haram area. The drive is easy and taxis know the area well.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

Warm lighting, Arabic decor, and background music that doesn't overwhelm conversation. It feels like a proper restaurant, not a canteen. Service is attentive without being intrusive.

When you need a break from kabsa and mandi, Relish delivers Lebanese cooking with genuine care. The mixed grill platter alone makes the trip worthwhile, and the overall dining experience is a notch above most options in the city.
