When you want something more substantial than fast food but don't want a formal dining experience, Al Tazaj fills the gap perfectly. Their charcoal-grilled chicken is marinated and cooked over real coals — you can smell it from the street.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The **whole chicken with Arabic rice** is the signature order for good reason. The meat is tender with a distinct smoky flavour, and the rice is properly spiced. Add a side of **hummus and fattoush** and you have a complete meal.

A whole chicken meal that feeds 3-4 people runs about **80-100 SAR** — excellent value for the quality. Individual meals from 30-45 SAR.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

Clean and spacious with a family section. It's not going to win design awards, but the tables are well-spaced and the service is quick. Good for groups who need to eat well and get back to the Haram without the fuss of fine dining or the compromise of fast food.
