---

When you want something more substantial than fast food but don't want a formal dining experience, Al Tazaj fills the gap perfectly. Their charcoal-grilled chicken is marinated and cooked over real coals — you can smell it from the street.

## The Food

The whole chicken with Arabic rice is the signature order for good reason. The meat is tender with a distinct smoky flavour, and the rice is properly spiced. Add a side of hummus and fattoush and you have a complete meal.

## The Space

Clean and spacious with a family section. It's not going to win design awards, but the tables are well-spaced and the service is quick. Good for groups who need to eat and get back to the Haram.

## Value

A whole chicken meal that feeds 3-4 people runs about 80-100 SAR — excellent value for the quality. Individual meals from 30-45 SAR.
