Sometimes during Umrah, you want a meal that feels like an event. Al Ruwad inside the Swissotel delivers that — a sweeping Arabic buffet with dishes prepared to a standard you rarely find this close to the Haram.

## The Buffet

The spread covers everything: grilled meats carved to order, traditional stews, fresh salads, Arabic pastries, and a dessert section that could be a restaurant on its own. Quality is consistent and the food is replenished frequently — no lukewarm leftovers.

## The Space

Elegant without being stuffy. High ceilings, comfortable seating, and enough space between tables that you don't feel rushed. Good for families, including those with elderly members who appreciate a calm dining environment.

## Worth the Price?

At around 150-200 SAR per person, it's a splurge by Makkah standards. But when you factor in the variety, quality, and the convenience of being steps from the Haram, it justifies itself — especially for a one-time treat.

## Our Take

Save Al Ruwad for a special evening — perhaps to mark the completion of your Umrah. The food and setting make it feel like a celebration.
