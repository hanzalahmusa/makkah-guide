Sometimes during Umrah, you want a meal that feels like an event. Al Ruwad inside the Swissotel delivers that — a sweeping Arabic buffet with dishes prepared to a standard you rarely find this close to the Haram.

<Collapsible title="What to order">

The spread covers everything: **grilled meats carved to order**, traditional stews, fresh salads, Arabic pastries, and a dessert section that could be a restaurant on its own. Quality is consistent and the food is replenished frequently — no lukewarm leftovers.

At around **150-200 SAR per person**, it's a splurge by Makkah standards. But when you factor in the variety, quality, and the convenience of being steps from the Haram, it justifies itself — especially for a one-time treat.

<Collapsible title="What's our take">

Save Al Ruwad for a special evening — perhaps to mark the completion of your Umrah. The food and setting make it feel like a celebration. Elegant without being stuffy, with high ceilings, comfortable seating, and enough space between tables that you don't feel rushed. Good for families, including those with elderly members who appreciate a calm dining environment.
