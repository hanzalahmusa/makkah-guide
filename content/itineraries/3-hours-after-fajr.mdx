This is the single biggest upgrade you can make to your Umrah trip, and almost nobody talks about it.

<Collapsible title="Who's it for">

- Anyone willing to stay awake after Fajr for 2-3 mornings during their trip
- Visitors looking for the most peaceful Haram experience possible
- Those who want to do tawaf without crowds

The Haram between Fajr and mid-morning is a different place. The crowds thin out, the temperature is bearable, and there's a stillness that you simply cannot access at any other time.
