---

The biggest mistake repeat visitors make is trying to cram everything into their first day. You've been here before. You know the rituals. This time, give yourself permission to arrive slowly.

## The Philosophy

Your first 24 hours set the tone for everything that follows. Rushing leads to exhaustion by day three. Starting gently means you can sustain energy and focus throughout your trip.

## Key Adjustments

- **Hydrate**: The dry air and travel dehydration compound. Drink more water than you think you need.
- **Time zone**: If you're more than 4 hours off your home time, plan for 2-3 days of adjustment.
- **Expectations**: Let go of the checklist mentality. You're here for the experience, not to tick boxes.
