Most Umrah visitors spend 100% of their time at the Haram. That's completely valid. But if you have a free afternoon and want to see another side of Makkah, this route gives you a taste of the city's culture and history.

## Who This Is For

This itinerary works best on a rest day — a day where you've decided to skip one of the five daily prayers at the Haram and explore instead. No guilt needed. The Prophet ﷺ lived in this city. There's history everywhere.

## Practical Notes

- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Bring water and a small bag for purchases
- Cash is useful in the souks (ATMs nearby)
- This route works in all seasons but is most pleasant in winter months
