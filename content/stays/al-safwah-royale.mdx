If your priority is being as close to the Haram as possible without the Abraj Al-Bait price tag, Al Safwah Royale hits the sweet spot. The covered walkway means you can reach the Haram gates in under 3 minutes, rain or shine.

## The Rooms

Clean, modern, and well-maintained. Request a higher floor for Haram views — worth the small upgrade fee. The standard rooms are compact but functional, with good AC and reliable WiFi.

## Food

The breakfast buffet is one of the better hotel offerings in the area. Good variety of Arabic and continental options. For other meals, you're within walking distance of dozens of restaurants.

## Our Verdict

This is our go-to recommendation for families on their second or third Umrah who want convenience without the absolute top-tier pricing. The location is genuinely unbeatable for the price point.
