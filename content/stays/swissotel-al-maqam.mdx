---

The Swissotel Al Maqam is one of Makkah's largest hotels, and its scale works in your favour. With 1600 rooms, you're more likely to find availability even during busy periods, and the infrastructure supports families in ways smaller hotels can't.

## Tunnel Access

The covered tunnel connecting the hotel to the Haram is the headline feature. No navigating traffic, no heat exposure — just a climate-controlled walkway that deposits you near the prayer areas.

## Family Suites

The family suites offer connecting rooms and enough space for kids to play without climbing the walls. The hotel also has a dedicated kids' area and family-friendly dining options.

## The Scale

Yes, it's big. The lobbies can feel like airports during peak times. But the upside is that everything you need is on-site: restaurants, shops, a business centre, and staff who are experienced with large group logistics.

## Our Take

The Swissotel Al Maqam is the practical choice for families who want reliable quality, Haram proximity, and enough space to manage the logistics of travelling with children. It won't charm you, but it will take care of you.
