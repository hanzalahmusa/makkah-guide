Travelling for Umrah with kids changes everything about what you need from a hotel. The Hilton Suites understands this — the separate living area alone is worth the premium when little ones need nap time and adults want to stay up.

## For Families

The suite layout gives you a proper bedroom plus a living room with a sofa bed. This means adults can pray, read, or plan the next day while kids sleep in the other room. It sounds simple, but it's a game-changer.

## The Details

Good buffet with kid-friendly options. Pool access (a rare find this close to the Haram). Reliable room service for those inevitable moments when everyone is too tired to go out.

## Our Take

If you're a family of 4-6 doing Umrah together, the per-person cost of a suite here often works out comparable to two standard hotel rooms elsewhere — with much better quality of life.
