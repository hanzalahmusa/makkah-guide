---

The Pullman ZamZam sits within the Abraj Al-Bait complex and delivers something special: rooms where you can see the Kaaba from your bed. For many visitors, waking up to that view is worth every riyal.

## The Rooms

The Haram-facing rooms are the reason to book here. Floor-to-ceiling windows frame the Kaaba and the courtyard below. At night, watching the Tawaf from your room becomes a private devotional moment.

## Breakfast

The breakfast buffet is extensive and well-maintained. Good Arabic and international options, fresh juices, and a made-to-order egg station. It's fuel for a full day of worship.

## Location

Being inside the Clock Tower complex gives you access to shopping, dining, and the direct underground passage to the Haram. The convenience factor is exceptional.

## Our Take

The Pullman ZamZam is about one thing: that view. If seeing the Kaaba from your room matters to you — and for many people, it profoundly does — then this hotel delivers that experience with consistent quality.
