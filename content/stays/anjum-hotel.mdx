---

The Anjum Hotel strikes a balance that many Makkah hotels miss: it's close enough to the Haram to be convenient, priced reasonably enough to be accessible, and equipped well enough to keep families comfortable.

## Family Focus

The family suites offer connecting rooms and enough floor space for kids to move around. The hotel's restaurants cater to varied palates, including kid-friendly options. Staff are experienced with families and accommodate requests without fuss.

## Location

Positioned opposite the Haram, the route is straightforward and well-lit at all hours. Seven minutes on foot is manageable for most, and taxis are readily available for those who prefer.

## Dining

Multiple on-site restaurants cover Arabic, international, and fast food options. When the family is tired and no one wants to venture out, you're covered.

## Our Take

Anjum is the sensible family choice. It won't wow you with luxury, but it delivers consistent quality, genuine convenience, and the kind of reliability that matters when you're managing kids, prayers, and a packed Umrah schedule.
