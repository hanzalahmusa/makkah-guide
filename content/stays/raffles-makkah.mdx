---

If you're going to splurge once in your life on Umrah accommodation, Raffles Makkah Palace is where that splurge should go. This is suite-only luxury with a butler who learns your name and your prayer schedule.

## The Suites

Every room is a suite. The smallest feels generous, and the larger ones feel like apartments. Marble bathrooms, premium linens, and a minibar that's actually thoughtfully stocked. The Haram-facing suites offer views that stop you mid-conversation.

## Butler Service

This isn't performative luxury — the butler service is genuinely useful. Need prayer times adjusted on your schedule? Done. Want dinner reservations timed between prayers? Arranged. It removes friction from your entire stay.

## The Quiet

Despite being minutes from the Haram, the hotel maintains an almost meditative calm. The lobby is hushed, the corridors are serene, and the sound insulation is exceptional.

## Our Take

Raffles redefines what "grounding" means in Makkah. It's not just quiet — it's designed to let you focus entirely on the spiritual purpose of your trip, with every material need anticipated and met.
