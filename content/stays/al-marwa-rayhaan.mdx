---

Al Marwa Rayhaan understands that Umrah is rarely a solo activity. The hotel is designed around the needs of groups — interconnected rooms, communal spaces, and logistics that support families travelling together.

## Group Travel Done Right

The interconnected room configuration means grandparents, parents, and children can be next door to each other without sharing a single room. For multi-generational groups, this layout solves the biggest accommodation headache.

## Umrah Focus

The hotel has an on-site prayer room, Quran copies in every room, and staff trained in Umrah logistics. They understand why you're here and orient their service accordingly.

## The Buffet

The restaurant serves a solid Arabic and international buffet. Quality is consistent, portions are generous, and the timing works around prayer schedules.

## Our Take

Al Marwa Rayhaan isn't the most glamorous hotel in Makkah, but it might be the most thoughtfully designed for its purpose. If you're coordinating a family group for Umrah, the interconnected rooms and Umrah-aware service make the logistics significantly easier.
