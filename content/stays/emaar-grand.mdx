Not everyone needs a five-star hotel for Umrah — and there's no spiritual premium for expensive accommodation. Emaar Grand proves that clean, comfortable, and affordable can coexist in Makkah.

## What You Get

Air-conditioned rooms that are clean and functional. Comfortable beds, reliable hot water, and housekeeping that maintains standards. It's basic, but basic done well is exactly what many travellers need.

## The Philosophy

If you're the kind of traveller who views the hotel as a place to sleep, shower, and recharge before heading back to the Haram, Emaar Grand aligns perfectly with that approach. Every riyal saved on accommodation is a riyal available for other things.

## Location

Nine minutes on foot to the Haram. The route is straightforward and most of it is through commercial areas with shops and restaurants. Taxis and ride-hailing are readily available.

## Our Take

Emaar Grand is for travellers who prioritise substance over style. It delivers the essentials reliably, keeps costs genuinely low, and supports a focused, prayer-centred Umrah without financial stress.
