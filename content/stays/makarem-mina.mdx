---

The Makarem Mina solves the budget traveller's biggest concern — distance — with a simple solution: a free shuttle that runs to and from the Haram throughout the day.

## The Shuttle

The shuttle service operates on a regular schedule aligned with prayer times. It eliminates the 15-minute walk and makes the hotel's further location a non-issue for most travellers. Just check the timetable and plan your day around it.

## The Rooms

Simple, clean, and functional. You get a bed, AC, a private bathroom, and enough space to store your luggage and pray comfortably. Housekeeping visits daily and maintains respectable standards.

## Who It's For

If you're staying a week or more, the savings at Makarem Mina add up significantly. The difference between this and a hotel near the Haram could fund the rest of your trip's dining and transportation.

## Our Take

Makarem Mina is an honest budget hotel that doesn't pretend to be anything else. The shuttle service is the game-changer that makes the distance workable, and the savings are real and meaningful for extended stays.
