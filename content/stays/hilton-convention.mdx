---

The Hilton Convention is built for groups, and it shows in every design decision. Wide corridors accommodate wheelchairs and families walking side by side. Prayer halls mean you don't always need to trek to the Haram for every salah. The infrastructure is designed for organised Umrah trips.

## Group Travel

If you're coordinating a group of 10 or more, the hotel's group booking rates and logistics support make a tangible difference. Dedicated check-in for groups, meeting rooms for planning sessions, and staff experienced in managing large party arrivals.

## The Facilities

On-site prayer halls are spacious and well-maintained. Multiple restaurants serve varied cuisines. The lobby is large enough that groups can gather without blocking other guests.

## Accessibility

The wide corridors and accessible design are a standout feature. For travellers using wheelchairs or walkers, the hotel is noticeably more comfortable to navigate than many competitors.

## Our Take

The Hilton Convention won't win awards for character, but it excels at what it's built for: comfortable, reliable accommodation for groups and families who need practical infrastructure more than boutique charm.
