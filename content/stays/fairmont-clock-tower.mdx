---

The Abraj Al-Bait Clock Tower is the most recognisable building in Makkah's skyline, and the Fairmont occupies its prime floors. Staying here means you're quite literally as close to the Haram as a hotel can be.

## The Location

Direct underground access means you can walk from your room to the Haram without ever stepping outside. During rain, extreme heat, or for families with mobility concerns, this is transformative.

## The Rooms

Well-appointed with the Fairmont's signature attention to detail. Haram-facing rooms command a premium but deliver views that you'll remember for life — watching Tawaf from your window at night is mesmerising.

## Living in the Tower

The complex houses restaurants, shops, a food court, and prayer facilities. You could technically never leave the building during your entire stay. Whether that's appealing depends on your travel style.

## Our Take

The Fairmont Clock Tower is the gold standard for proximity. If your primary goal is maximising time at the Haram with minimum travel friction, this is the definitive choice. Just book early — availability evaporates quickly.
