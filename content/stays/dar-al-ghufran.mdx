Sometimes the best thing about your accommodation is that it gives you space to breathe. Dar Al Ghufran sits on a quieter street where the pace of the city slows down a notch.

## Why We Like It

The slightly longer walk to the Haram (about 8 minutes) buys you something precious: quiet. The neighbourhood around the hotel has a more residential feel, and the rooftop offers a beautiful vantage point for reflection.

## The Rooms

Nothing fancy, but spacious by Makkah standards. The AC works well, beds are comfortable, and housekeeping is consistent. If you're staying a week or more, the extra space matters.

## Getting Around

The hotel provides a shuttle service during prayer times, which solves the uphill return problem. Alternatively, a quick taxi ride costs 5-10 SAR.
