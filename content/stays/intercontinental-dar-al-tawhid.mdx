One minute. That's the walk from the InterContinental Dar Al Tawhid to the gates of Masjid al-Haram. No other hotel in Makkah can make that claim, and for many travellers, that proximity is priceless.

## The Location

You step out of the hotel lobby and you're essentially at the Haram gates. For elderly travellers, those with mobility challenges, or anyone wanting to maximise their prayer time, this changes the entire Umrah experience.

## The Rooms

The property is older than many competitors, and that shows in some of the fixtures. But the rooms are well-maintained, clean, and functional. Kaaba-facing rooms offer views that justify the premium — you're looking directly at the holiest site in Islam from your window.

## Dining

Al Deyafa restaurant on-site is one of Makkah's better hotel buffets. The convenience of excellent food this close to the Haram cannot be overstated.

## Our Take

The InterContinental Dar Al Tawhid sells one thing better than anyone: proximity. If being the absolute closest to the Haram is your priority, this is the only real answer. The premium is steep, but for many, it's a once-in-a-lifetime investment.
