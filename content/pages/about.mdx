## The Problem

Makkah welcomes millions of visitors every year, yet there's no independent, editorial city guide for the city. Official platforms focus on logistics and regulations. Travel blogs offer surface-level listicles. Hotel booking sites care about conversions, not your experience.

We thought Makkah deserved better.

## Our Approach

We treat Makkah the way the best city guides treat any world-class destination: with respect, editorial voice, and genuine local knowledge. We're not selling hotel rooms. We're not an official tourism board. We're experienced visitors sharing what we've learned.

Every recommendation is based on personal experience. We visit, we test, we form opinions, and we share them honestly. If something is overrated, we'll say so. If a hidden gem exists, we'll tell you about it.

## Who We Are

We're a small team of repeat Umrah visitors who believe the experience of visiting Makkah extends far beyond the rituals. The city itself — its food, its history, its rhythms — deserves attention and appreciation.

## Editorial Independence

This guide is independently operated. We don't accept payment for reviews or listings. Our recommendations are our own.
