## Why This Exists

Makkah welcomes millions of visitors every year, yet there's no independent, editorial city guide for the city. Official platforms focus on logistics and regulations. Travel blogs offer surface-level listicles. Hotel booking sites care about conversions, not your experience.

We thought Makkah deserved better.

## Our Approach

We treat Makkah the way the best city guides treat any world-class destination: with respect, editorial voice, and genuine local knowledge. We're not selling hotel rooms. We're not an official tourism board. We're experienced visitors sharing what we've learned.

Every recommendation is based on personal experience. We visit, we test, we form opinions, and we share them honestly. If something is overrated, we'll say so. If a hidden gem exists, we'll tell you about it.

## Who We Are

We're a small team of locals and long-time visitors who believe there's far more to experiencing Makkah than what most trips allow. The city itself — its food, its history, its rhythm — deserves attention and appreciation.
