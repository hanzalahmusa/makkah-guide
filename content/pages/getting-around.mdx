Makkah's transport landscape has improved dramatically in recent years, but it still has quirks that catch visitors off guard. Here's the real picture.

## Walking

If you're staying within 500m of the Haram, walking will cover 80% of your needs. The pedestrian infrastructure in the central area is good and improving. Key things to know:

- **Tunnels**: The pedestrian tunnels under the main roads are well-lit and safe. They save you from navigating traffic.
- **Hills**: Makkah is built on hills. The walk *to* the Haram is usually downhill. The walk *back* is uphill. Factor this into your energy planning.
- **Shade**: The covered walkways along the main approaches to the Haram provide shade. Learn which route from your hotel is most covered.

## Ride-Hailing (Uber/Careem)

This is the most reliable option for longer distances. Careem generally has better coverage in Makkah than Uber.

- During Hajj and peak Ramadan, surge pricing is real. Budget accordingly.
- Drop-off points near the Haram are restricted. Your driver will drop you at the nearest accessible point.
- Tip: Set your pickup location to a landmark, not a random pin. Drivers navigate better to named locations.

## Taxis

Metered taxis exist but many still operate on negotiated fares. Always agree on a price before getting in. Typical fares:

- Within central Makkah: 10-25 SAR
- To Jabal Noor: 15-20 SAR
- To Azizia area: 20-30 SAR

## Hotel Shuttles

Many hotels offer free shuttle services to the Haram, especially during prayer times. Ask at reception — this is often the most convenient option and saves you the uphill walk back.

## The Haramain High-Speed Train

Connects Makkah to Madinah via Jeddah. The Makkah station is at Al-Rusaifah, about 20 minutes from the Haram by car. Tickets book up quickly during peak season — book at least a few days in advance via the SAR app.
