These are the things you learn after multiple visits. Each tip here has been tested personally and saved us time, money, or frustration.

## Packing

- **Shoes you can carry**: You'll remove shoes constantly. Choose slip-ons that fit in a bag. Dedicated shoe bags are worth it.
- **Portable charger**: Your phone is your map, translator, and prayer time tracker. A dead phone in the Haram is stressful.
- **Unscented sunscreen**: The sun is fierce. Unscented is important during ihram.
- **Electrolyte packets**: More useful than you'd think. The dry heat dehydrates you faster than you realize.

## Money

- **Cards are widely accepted** in malls, chain restaurants, and hotels. But carry cash for souks, small shops, and taxis.
- **ATMs**: Available everywhere near the Haram. Al Rajhi and NCB ATMs have the best international card support.
- **Tipping**: Not culturally mandatory, but appreciated. 5-10 SAR for exceptional service.

## Health

- **Stay hydrated**: This cannot be overstated. The dry air and physical demands of Umrah mean you need 3-4 liters daily.
- **Sleep**: Your body needs recovery. Don't sacrifice every night for Tahajjud — alternate nights.
- **Blisters**: Break in your walking shoes before the trip. Bring blister plasters.
- **Pharmacies**: Well-stocked and often open late. Most common medications available without prescription.

## Etiquette

- **Photography**: Be mindful. The Haram interior is generally a no-photo zone during prayer. The courtyards and exterior are fine.
- **Queuing**: Patience is part of the experience. Queue-cutting is unfortunately common — model good behaviour.
- **Zamzam water**: Available free throughout the Haram. Bring a reusable bottle.

## Timing

- **Best months**: Rajab and Sha'ban (outside Ramadan) offer the best balance of spiritual atmosphere and manageable crowds.
- **Avoid**: The first and last weeks of Ramadan are extremely crowded.
- **Prayer positioning**: Arrive 20-30 minutes early for a comfortable spot. During peak times, 45 minutes.
