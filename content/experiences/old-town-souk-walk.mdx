The souks around Al-Mudda'a are where Makkah feels most like a living city rather than a pilgrimage destination. Narrow lanes filled with oud vendors, spice shops, and fabric stores — this is the Makkah that locals know.

## The Route

Start near the Bin Dawood area and head south into the older streets. You'll find clusters of shops organized by type: perfume sellers in one section, fabric in another, household goods in a third.

## What to Look For

- **Oud and Bakhoor**: Makkah's perfume shops are legendary. Don't be shy about asking to sample — it's expected and welcomed.
- **Zamzam containers**: From simple to ornate, these make meaningful gifts.
- **Dates**: The variety goes far beyond what you see at hotel breakfast buffets.
- **Prayer garments**: Higher quality and better prices than hotel gift shops.

## Tips

Bargaining is acceptable but keep it respectful. Start at about 60-70% of the asking price and meet in the middle. Many vendors speak basic English, but a few Arabic phrases go a long way.

## When to Go

Late afternoon is ideal — the heat has broken, shops are freshly open after Dhuhr rest, and the lighting is beautiful for photos.
