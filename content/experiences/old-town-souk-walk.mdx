The souks around Al-Mudda'a are where Makkah feels most like a living city rather than a pilgrimage destination. Narrow lanes filled with oud vendors, spice shops, and fabric stores — this is the Makkah that locals know.

<Collapsible title="Why it's worth doing">

Most visitors never leave the hotel-Haram corridor. These souks offer a completely different side of Makkah — one that's been here for centuries. The colours, the scents, the conversations between vendors and regulars. It's the city beyond the pilgrimage.

<Collapsible title="How to do it">

Start near the Bin Dawood area and head south into the older streets. You'll find clusters of shops organized by type: perfume sellers in one section, fabric in another, household goods in a third.

**What to look for:**
- **Oud and Bakhoor**: Makkah's perfume shops are legendary. Don't be shy about asking to sample — it's expected and welcomed.
- **Zamzam containers**: From simple to ornate, these make meaningful gifts.
- **Dates**: The variety goes far beyond what you see at hotel breakfast buffets.
- **Prayer garments**: Higher quality and better prices than hotel gift shops.

Bargaining is acceptable but keep it respectful. Start at about 60-70% of the asking price and meet in the middle. Many vendors speak basic English, but a few Arabic phrases go a long way.

<Collapsible title="Good to know">

- Late afternoon is ideal — the heat has broken, shops are freshly open after Dhuhr rest
- Most shops close during prayer times — plan around that
- Cash is preferred in the souks, though some accept card
- Wear comfortable shoes — the streets are uneven in places
- The lighting in the late afternoon is beautiful for photos
