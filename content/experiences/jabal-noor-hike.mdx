The hike to the Cave of Hira on Jabal Noor is one of the most physically demanding things you can do in Makkah — and one of the most rewarding. This is where the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ received the first verses of the Quran.

<Collapsible title="Why it's worth doing">

This is history you can physically touch. Standing in the cave where Surah Al-Alaq was first revealed is unlike any other experience in Makkah. The climb itself gives you time to reflect, and the view of the city spreading out below is striking. Most people spend 15-30 minutes at the top before descending.

<Collapsible title="How to do it">

The hike takes about 45-90 minutes each way depending on your fitness level. The path is steep and uneven, with some sections requiring you to use your hands. There's no shade for most of the route.

**Essentials:**
- **Start early**: Before 8 AM is non-negotiable. The heat makes a midday attempt dangerous.
- **Water**: Bring at least 2 liters per person.
- **Footwear**: Proper closed-toe shoes with grip. Not sandals.
- **Fitness**: Be honest with yourself. If you have knee or heart conditions, this isn't recommended.

**Getting there:** A taxi from the Haram area takes about 10 minutes and costs 15-20 SAR. Ask to be dropped at the base of the mountain where the stairway begins.

<Collapsible title="Good to know">

- The cave itself is small — a narrow opening in the rock where you can sit
- There are no facilities on the mountain — use restrooms before starting
- Local vendors sell water at the base, but bring your own to be safe
- The descent is harder on the knees than the climb — take it slow
- Not recommended for children under 10 or anyone with mobility issues
