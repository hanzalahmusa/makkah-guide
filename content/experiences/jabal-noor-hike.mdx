The hike to the Cave of Hira on Jabal Noor is one of the most physically demanding things you can do in Makkah — and one of the most rewarding. This is where the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ received the first verses of the Quran.

## The Climb

The hike takes about 45-90 minutes each way depending on your fitness level. The path is steep and uneven, with some sections requiring you to use your hands. There's no shade for most of the route.

## Practical Essentials

- **Start early**: Before 8 AM is non-negotiable. The heat makes a midday attempt dangerous.
- **Water**: Bring at least 2 liters per person.
- **Footwear**: Proper closed-toe shoes with grip. Not sandals.
- **Fitness**: Be honest with yourself. If you have knee or heart conditions, this isn't recommended.

## At the Top

The cave itself is small — a narrow opening in the rock where you can sit and reflect. The view of Makkah spreading out below is striking. Most people spend 15-30 minutes here before descending.

## Getting There

A taxi from the Haram area takes about 10 minutes and costs 15-20 SAR. Ask to be dropped at the base of the mountain where the stairway begins.
