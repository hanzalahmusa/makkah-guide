There's something about watching the sky shift from deep navy to soft gold while the Haram stretches out below you. This isn't a scheduled tour — it's a moment you create for yourself.

## Why This Matters

Most visitors rush between prayers and sleep. But the minutes after Fajr, when the crowds thin and the city is still waking, are some of the most peaceful you'll find in Makkah.

## How to Do It

Head to the upper levels of the Abraj Al-Bait complex after Fajr prayer. The terraces on the eastern side give you an unobstructed view of the sunrise. Bring a light jacket — the morning air at elevation can surprise you.

## What to Bring

- A light jacket or shawl
- Your phone for photos (but consider putting it away for the first 10 minutes)
- A small Quran or dhikr beads if that's part of your practice

## Our Take

This is the kind of experience that repeat visitors discover on their second or third trip. It costs nothing, requires no planning, and will likely become a highlight of your journey.
